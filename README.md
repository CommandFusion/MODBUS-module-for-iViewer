# MODBUS module for iViewer

This module provides support for talking to MODBUS devices over TCP/IP.

It provides support for some basic calls. Contributions for additional calls are welcome.


## Current Status

Implemented command calls 01 through 06 and 0F. See file `modbus.js` for documentation and list of calls.

An example of use is in `main.js` (along with some testing code).
